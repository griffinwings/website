## Additional setup

### Series search options

If you want to search for series across all your sources, you can use the Global Search feature.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to the main section.
1. Use the search bar in the toolbar to find series from all available sources.

### Trouble finding a specific series?

If you encounter difficulties while searching for a specific series, consider the following points:

* Double-check your spelling and try again, as some sources might use **Japanese romanized** titles instead of **English** ones.
  > Example: **Boku no Hero Academia** instead of **My Hero Academia**.

* Some sources may use different spellings or wordings for titles.
  > Example: **Bungo Stray Dogs** instead of **Bungou Stray Dogs**

  > Example: **3-gatsu no Lion** instead of **Sangatsu no Lion**.
