# Sources
Frequently Asked Questions about Sources.

## What are some recommended sources?
**Kotatsu** does not endorse or recommend any source, and there is no best source.

Instead, we encourage users to spend some time trying out a few sources themselves and discover what sources work best for them.
What works well for somebody else might not work well for you.

::: info Disclaimer
**Kotatsu** isn't responsible for slow, down, missing chapters, or subpar image quality of sources as it doesn't host content.
:::

## What is a scanlator source?
Non-officially licensed series are translated by scanlators, often found on their websites or [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/).
Learn more in this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanlation).

## How do I request new sources?
[Open an issue](https://github.com/KotatsuApp/kotatsu-parsers/issues) on **GitHub** if not already there.
Check the removed [parsers list](https://github.com/KotatsuApp/kotatsu-parsers/issues/39) first.

## Why was a source removed?
Sources can be removed due to several reasons:

* Frequent website changes.
* Image scrambling.
* Scanlator removal request.
* Paywall implementation.
* Reverse engineering needs.
* Site shutdown.

Find the list of removed sources [here](https://github.com/KotatsuApp/kotatsu-parsers/issues/39), excluding offline sites.
