## Is Kotatsu available for iOS/iPadOS?
There is no iOS or iPadOS version and neither are there plans for one.
Porting is difficult due to the separate codebases of iOS and Android apps.

Any app proclaiming to be "**Kotatsu for iOS**" is not by us and should be treated as a scam.

## Can I read light novels?
**Kotatsu** can't read light novels; it's an image parser, not a text parser.

## Can I stream anime?
**Kotatsu** isn't designed for anime streaming.

Projects using the **Kotatsu** name for anime streaming aren't affiliated with the main project.

## Can I use Kotatsu on desktop?
No, you can't.

:::tip Note
[kotatsu-dl](https://github.com/KotatsuApp/kotatsu-dl) is a manga downloader for Windows, Mac and Linux, but you can't read from it.
:::

## Can Kotatsu sync across devices?
Yes, the application supports synchronization between devices.

Learn how to create a Kotatsu Sync account [here](/manuals/guides/synchronization/)

## What do I do if I have to switch to a new phone?

Please follow these steps:
1. Backup your entire favourites and history from your old device and transfer it to your new phone.
1. Restore the backup.

:::tip Note
More information about backup and restore is listed [here](/manuals/guides/backups/).
:::

## Can I restore my Tachiyomi backup to Kotatsu?
No, you can't. This is due to the difficulty in supporting and adapting the `.proto.gz` or `.tachibk` format that **Tachiyomi** uses. Also **Kotatsu** and **Tachiyomi** and its forks have different data structures that they use. For **Neko for MangaDex** users we recommend to use [Nekotatsu](https://github.com/PhantomShift/nekotatsu).

:::tip Usage from project README
`$ nekotatsu (input neko.tachibk) (optional output name)`
