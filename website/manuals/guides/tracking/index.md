# Tracking
Tracking helps you automatically send read chapters to supported trackers, so you can keep track of what and when you read it online.

## Services

Kotatsu (version {{ release.stable.tag_name }}) supports the following services: [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/), [AniList](https://anilist.co/), and [Shikimori](https://shikimori.one/).

- Tracking is manual for each entry.
- Reading the last page of a chapter marks it as read.
- Offline progress syncs when online.
- Completion status auto-updates.
- Tracking is one-way: **Kotatsu -> Tracker**.
